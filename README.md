# WebSkills

ReactJS application that uses Create-React-App and the React-icons library.

It's a game that tries to reflect in a playful way the beginning of a web developer's professional journey. Images of web-related technologies appear on the screen randomly and you need to click on them to score points. Highscores are saved locally using the client browser's localStorage.

I hope you guys have fun!!!
